# SCrollHelper-WoW
A very simple add-on to streamline rolls commonly used for roleplaying. You can set up to 20 custom rolls with names and modifiers which will be easily accessible in a menu. This project was made with two goals in ,mind: To aid my roleplaying guild with a simple, yet functional addon, to easily perform and save rolls used within a combat system. This regardless of what the actual combat system is. Secondly, this addon was made as a learning experience in my pursuit to learn how to code and how to code using lua. Therefore, you will not see any XML or Ace3 usage, even if such would have made for a possibly better addon experience or faster development. On the other hand the use of pure lua code means the project is incredibly small and resource efficient.
